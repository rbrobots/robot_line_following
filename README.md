# robot_line_following

This project allows the Romi robot to do line following.
This includes following a line to an end point and returning to the start point via euclidian distance and relevant angle rotation.

Please note that the PID will need to be extensively updated based on your robot and physical dimensions.
The code should not make use of delays, so these will need to be removed in a future version.
